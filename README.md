# JWT Authorisation testing API

## Setup
- Set custom working directory by picking target > Edit Scheme > Run > Options > Working Directory (choose the folder with the project in it)
- Set MacOS Sharing hostname (if not set already) by going to Settings > Sharing > Local hostname. By default it's development.local, but in case you are in an office with multiple people connected to the same network with the same local hostname alias, I recommend changing it to something custom.
